### Hi there 👋

I'm Sebastiano Chiari. I graduated in March 2020 (pandemic time 🦠) in Computer Science (bachelor's degree) at the University of Trento with a thesis regarding a Social Force Model implementation.

🔭 I'm currently attending the M.Sc in Computer Science at the University of Trento, with a focus on **artificial intelligence** and **computer vision** techniques. I'm also a student collaborator at the [MMLAB](https://mmlab.disi.unitn.it/home) (Multimedia Signal Processing and Understanding Lab), working on a Unity-based crowd simulator.

🔥 I'm very passionate about web-developing, tech events and everything related to the videogames industry (one of my dreams would be to work for a major video game development house).

📫 You can find my website, email and more info about me in the profile section ⬅️
