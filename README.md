### Hi there 👋

I'm Sebastiano Chiari. I graduated in March 2020 (pandemic time 🦠) in Computer Science (bachelor's degree) at the University of Trento with a thesis regarding a Social Force Model implementation.

🎮 I worked for two years @ [Strelka Games](https://www.strelkagames.com/), first as a QA Tester, then as Project Manager. We published our first videogame, [Hell Is Others](https://store.steampowered.com/app/964440/Hell_is_Others/).

🔭 I'm currently finishing the M.Sc in Computer Science at the University of Trento, with a focus on **artificial intelligence** and **computer vision** techniques. I'm working on my master thesis within the [MMLAB](https://mmlab.disi.unitn.it/home) (Multimedia Signal Processing and Understanding Lab), working on a Unity-based crowd simulator.

🔥 I'm very passionate about software engineering, videogames and tech events. I especially enjoy being outside in the wilderness as much as in front of the computer: if I'm not playing Baldur's Gate III, you can find me cycling, climbing or hiking somewhere in the Dolomites region.
